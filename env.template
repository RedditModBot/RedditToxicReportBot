# LLM Configuration (Groq - FREE!)
# =========================
# Get your FREE API key at https://console.groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_xxxxx

# Model options (all free on Groq):
# - groq/compound (smartest, routes to best model, 250/day limit)
# - llama-3.3-70b-versatile (very smart, 1K/day limit)
# - llama-3.1-8b-instant (fast, 14.4K/day limit)
# - meta-llama/llama-guard-4-12b (content moderation specific, 14.4K/day)
LLM_MODEL=groq/compound

# Fallback model when daily limit is reached (leave empty to disable)
# Recommended: llama-3.3-70b-versatile as fallback for groq/compound
LLM_FALLBACK_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-versatile

# Switch to fallback after this many API calls per day
# Set slightly below your model's limit (e.g., 240 for groq/compound's 250 limit)
LLM_DAILY_LIMIT=240

# Max requests per minute to Groq (prevents rate limiting)
# Default 2 = one request every 30 seconds max
LLM_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=2

# =========================
# Detoxify Pre-filter
# =========================
# Detoxify runs locally to decide what gets sent to the LLM.
# Comments scoring BELOW this threshold are skipped (not sent to Groq).
# Comments scoring ABOVE this threshold are sent to Groq for analysis.
#
# Lower = more comments sent to LLM (more API calls, fewer misses)
# Higher = fewer comments sent to LLM (fewer API calls, might miss some)
#
# Recommended: 0.3 to 0.5
DETOXIFY_THRESHOLD=0.3

# Detoxify model: "original" (more aggressive) or "unbiased" (more conservative)
DETOXIFY_MODEL=original
