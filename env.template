# Default chain provides good coverage across different rate limits

# Model options (all free on Groq):
# - groq/compound: Smart routing, unlimited tokens, 250 req/day
# - llama-3.3-70b-versatile: Best quality, 100K tokens/day
# - meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct: Good quality, 500K tokens/day

# Detoxify Pre-filter
# =========================
# Detoxify runs locally to decide what gets sent to the LLM.
# Lower = more comments sent to LLM (more API calls, fewer misses)
# Higher = fewer comments sent to LLM (fewer API calls, might miss some)

# Detoxify model: "original" (more aggressive) or "unbiased" (more conservative)

# =========================
# Detection Thresholds
# =========================
# Per-label thresholds for Detoxify scores (0.0 to 1.0)
# If ANY score exceeds its threshold, comment is sent to AI for review
# Lower = more sensitive (catches more, but more API calls)
# Higher = less sensitive (misses some, but fewer API calls)

# High-priority categories (keep low to catch threats)
THRESHOLD_THREAT=0.15
THRESHOLD_SEVERE_TOXICITY=0.20
THRESHOLD_IDENTITY_ATTACK=0.25

# Insults (different thresholds for directed vs not directed at user)
# "Directed" = contains "you", "your", "OP", or is a reply
THRESHOLD_INSULT_DIRECTED=0.40
THRESHOLD_INSULT_NOT_DIRECTED=0.60

# General toxicity (also has directed/not directed)
THRESHOLD_TOXICITY_DIRECTED=0.40
THRESHOLD_TOXICITY_NOT_DIRECTED=0.50

# Obscene language (keep high - profanity alone isn't necessarily toxic)

# Borderline skip notification threshold
# Comments scoring above this but below other thresholds are logged as "borderline"
